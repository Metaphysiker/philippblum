  {title: "Services to the profession", text: "  <h2>dialectica</h2>\r\n  <p>Since 1999, I am managing editor of the Swiss philosophy journal <a href=\"http://dialectica.philosophie.ch/\">dialectica</a>, since 2004 published by Blackwell-Wiley. Founded in 1947 by Bachelard, Bernays and Gonseth, <b>dialectica</b> is now one of the best academic philosophy journals edited on the European Continent. Since 1999, I have been taking care of its day-to-day functioning, as well as the contact with authors and referees, and reading and evaluating (almost) every article. A year before <b>dialectica</b>'s long-time editor Henri Lauener died in 2002, I started collaborating with Gianfranco Soldati, appointed in 2000 to the University of Fribourg. Together, we managed to get <b>dialectica</b> published by Blackwell-Wiley and reduced the acceptance rate from over 20 % to 8 % (while the number of submissions tripled). Subsequently, I continued to work as managing editor and co-editor with Pascal Engel and then Marcel Weber: during this period, the number of submissions doubled again, now ranging from 250 to 300 per year, while we further reduced the acceptance rate to almost 8% and the median turnaround time to about 3 months. Dialectica is now ranked “A” in the European Research Index of the Humanities and the Australian Research Council’s ERA, is accessible to 5005 institutions worldwide and had about 38’264 full article downloads in 2017.\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n  <h2>outreach</h2>\r\n  <p>I have undertaken two other initiatives to connect academic philosophy with the world outside the ivory tower:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"decouvrir.php\">D&eacute;couvrir la Philosophie</a> -- Portes Ouvertes au Laboratoire d'Exp&eacute;riences de Pens&eacute;e du D&eacute;partement de Philosophie de l'Universit&eacute; de Gen&egrave;ve, a highly successful serious of Saturday-afternoon introductions to some of the problems of our discipline;\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.philosophie.ch/philomaton-mobile/\">Le Philomaton Mobile</a>, a virtual laboratory, where anyone can ask questions or make comments, and philosophers answer or react.\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <br>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h2>www.philosophie.ch</h2>\r\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.philosophie.ch\"><b>www.philosophie.ch</b></a>, the Swiss Portal for philosophy, is an outreach project I started in 2002. It aims at making available under one adress all information relevant to philosophy in Switzerland:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>to provide academics with a quick overview over colloquia, talks and other activities of Swiss philosophy departments;\r\n    <li>to offer to high-school students and other people interested in pursuing philosophy at university level up-to-date and authoritative information about their possibilities, the offers of the Swiss philosophy departments and their respective requirements;\r\n    <li>to further the contacts between philosophical academia and the broader public, by offering to people generally interested in philosophy high-quality information about philosophy as pursued academically.\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>The portal is widely used (more than 12’500 visits per month, excluding robots et al) and generously funded, both by the philosophy departments and private institutions, mostly by the Charles Hummer foundation, having now a annual turnaround of about 150’000 CHF. The internet portal <a href=\"http://www.philosophie.ch\"><b>www.philosophie.ch</b></a> is unique in its reach and professionality and has substantially contributed to the development of Swiss academic philosophy.\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h2>ousia, the Centre for the Philosophy and Theology of Being at the University of Lucerne</h2>\r\n  <p>In Lucerne, I have founded <b>ousia</b>, an institutionally recognised umbrella for the research activities of the philosophers working in ancient, medieval philosophy and the philosophy of religion in Lucerne, the SNSF project \"Ontologie in der Schweiz\" and the Doctoral Programme of the same name.

Under the direction of Kevin Mulligan and Fabrice Correia, I've been its scientific coordinator for about 7 years.  I have also been coordinating one of its three founding research projects, the Swiss National Science Foundation  project \"Properties and Relations\" (the largest post-doc project ever funded in the humanities by the SNSF), and was involved in the Sinergia project \"Intentionality - the Mark of the Mental\", involving three PhD students and the Marie Curie Initial Training Network funded by the FP7 \"The Perspectivality of Thoughts and Facts\" including (in Geneva) one PhD student.

  {title: "Research Interests", text: "  <p>I am working mostly in metaphysics, but have interests in the philosophies of logic, language and the mind, in epistemology, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of perception and the philosophy of law.\r\n\r\n  <p>In case you are interested in my CV, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/getpdf/cv\">here it is</a>.\r\n\r\n  <p>At the moment, I am pursuing the following research projects, in no particular order (details and outputs below). Drafts are password-protected -- please ask me or guess (it's obvious...):\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><b>Fundamentally, there are no relations</b>. I argue that fundamentally/really/in fact, there are no relations. Aristotle, the medievals and Leibniz were right and Russell was wrong. There is structure, however, and\r\n    <li><b>Qua Qua Qua</b>. Qua objects, if only they could be made sense of, would be the real philosophers' paradise. Some proposals have been made, but the very rich treasury of historical antecedents has not yet been tapped into. This long.term project aims to develop, making full use of the history of philosophy, a systematic theory of qua objects (roles, aspects, cooky objects, accidental unities) and make a case for them by showing their theoretical usefulness across a wide range of traditional philosophical problems.\r\n    <li><b>How to Prove Your Existence in Three Simple Steps</b>. This grew out of my book on Descartes, a German-style rationalist reconstruction of the first three <i>Meditations</i> that itself grew out of my MA thesis. Over the years, it has put on some weight: it now includes (arguments for) controversial claims regarding the distinction between the analytic and the synthetic method\r\n      material falsity of ideas,\r\n    <li><b>An Ontology of Perspectives</b>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\r\n  <h2 name=\"books\">Books</h2><a name=\"\">\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><b>Fundamentally, there are no relations</b>. Is relationality a fundamental feature of reality? Are relations reducible to monadic properties? I argue that these two questions are different, that the answer to both is \"no\", and that there is no tension between these two claims. Even though relational predications are indispensable, for both logical and metaphysical reasons, their truthmakers are structural, not relational facts. Relations – qualitative entities that have a direction and order their particulars – are not, and cannot be, fundamental. At the fundamental level of reality we do not find relations, but pure, irreducible and nonrelational structure. Russell’s famous arguments in the <i>Principles</i> do indeed rule out what he calls ‘monadism’ (the claim that every relational predication is equivalent to predications of only monadic predicates), but they fall short of refuting 'monism’: relational predications may be made true by monadic properties of wholes – and indeed are, if there are no fundamental relations. <br>\r\n      On the way to this conclusion, I examine different recent conceptions of relations, and argue that they all succumb to what I call the 'problem of converses'. The problem of converses arises from the fact that any account of relations according to which there are, or might be, non-symmetric relations, allows for what I call an ‘abstractionist’ definition of converse relations. Such converses then give rise to problems of ontological profligacy, metaphysical indeterminacy and infinite regress. Friends of relations have to accept that the facts of the cat being on the mat and of the mat being beneath the cat are different, that it is indeterminate which one is more fundamental and that the difference between the relations being on top of and being under cannot be spelled out in a non-circular way and has to be accepted as ‘brute’ – a package of claims which I take to be a reductio of the assumption that there are fundamental relations. <br>\r\n      Aristotle, the medievals, Leibniz and Spinoza were thus right, the modern orthodoxy is wrong: relations are not what explains how the world forms an inter-connected whole, but are on the contrary viewpoint-relative and perspectival abstractions from a prior structure. To many, such a conclusion will appear unbelievably ‘retro’: did not the Cambridge revolt against idealism rest on the case that modern logic showed the indis- pensability of relations? To assuage such worries, I take a closer look on the debate that is usually taken to have conclusively shown the need for relations: the famous exchange between Russell and the British Ideal- ists at the beginning of the last century. A proper understanding of the promise and the demise of Russell’s multiple relation theory of judgment, I argue, shows that Bradley was right: how relations relate can be understood only if they are seen as arising from, and being grounded in, metaphysically prior structure. It does not show that Russell was wrong, however: his theory can indeed be salvaged if couched in structuralist, not relational terms.\r\n    <li><b>How Things Are</b>, a very extensively expanded (and substantially revised) version of my thesis, in seven parts (of which (parts of) the first three comprised my thesis);\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Determination -- a defense and generalisation of Fine's critique of modal accounts of essence, including an argument for non-modal and contingent concepts of essence and supervenience;\r\n        <li>A Theory of Truthmaking -- an analysis, and defense, of the core idea of truthmaker theory, including an argument against truthmaking necessitarianism;\r\n        <li>Properties and their Kind(s) -- a novel defense of the truthmaker argument in favour of properties, and an extension of it to a defense of Aristotelian universals, including an original account of determinables in terms of determination;\r\n        <li>Universals -- a novel account of intrinsicness used in an argument that, fundamentally, there are no relations, while tthere may well be intrinsic structure;\r\n        <li>Exemplification -- a defense of the view that exemplification is a relation, that it explains the unity we observe in the world and that properties are parts of the particulars that exemplify them;\r\n        <li>Generalised adverbialism -- a novel account of adverbial modification and its application to the problem of temporary intrinsics and the philosophy of modality;\r\n        <li>Qua qua qua -- a defense that so-called `qua objects' (`Picasso qua painter') are the referents of adverbially modified noun phrases, ontologically kosher and theoretically very useful.\r\n      </ul>\r\n    <li><b>Introduction &agrave; la logique</b> (375 pages), a comprehensive introductory logic course in French, to be used for a one-year first-year logic course;\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>This is the first (!!) comprehensive introduction to logic for philosophers written in French. It differs from Lepage's (1991) introduction and from the available translations of Quine (1971) by covering both natural deduction and tree methods, including correctness and completeness proofs for both propositional and predicate logic, and by paying particular (and non-partisan) attention to philosophical questions.
